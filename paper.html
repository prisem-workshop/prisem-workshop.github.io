<p>
Security and privacy are critical issues in modern organizations. Enterprise business processes and their supporting systems have to constantly evolve in order to comply with security and privacy policies. Complex organizational structures and their distributed business processes make such compliance a major effort. Moreover, the intersection between privacy and security technologies and software engineering has tremendous implications on the very way information systems are modeled for their design and development. These changes affect the requirements and software engineering processes in organizations. That is why security and privacy requirements have to be explicitly addressed in enterprise models while technologies supporting security and privacy have to become an integrated part of Enterprise Architecture.
</p>
<p>
Emerging technologies such as distributed ledgers, privacy-enhancing technologies, and blockchains leverage powerful cryptography features, all-purpose Turing-complete programming languages and flexible communication models. They are considered as new transparency security and privacy enablers for distributed processing without requiring a trusted third-party. Today, their integration within information systems is a difficult task for enterprise architects due to the paradigm-shifting nature of those technologies and the lack of adequate models and tools from the enterprise modeling community. This paradigmatic shift can also be explained with privacy-enhancing technologies coming from a tradition of privacy as confidentiality. This area is under explored and yet to be understood.
</p>
<p>
The goal of PriSEMâ€™20 is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss theoretical and practical problems and solutions in a rapidly maturing domain of enterprise security and privacy. The integration of security and privacy aspects in enterprise models is a central theme of this workshop.
</p> 

<p>Two types of papers are possible:</p>
<h4>Paper</h4>
<p>Two types of paper submissions are solicited: a) scientific research papers, and b) industry experience reports or case studies.</p>
<p>
Scientific research papers should describe original results not been accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere. These papers will be evaluated based on their scientific and technical contribution, originality, and relevance.
</p>
<p>
In turn, industry experience reports should provide new insights gained in case studies or when applying enterprise computing technology in practice; industry experience reports shall further provide important feedback about the state of practice and pose challenges for researchers. These papers will be evaluated based on their appropriateness, significance, and clarity. Industry experience reports must report an actual implementation in practice and must have at least one author with an industry affiliation.
</p>
