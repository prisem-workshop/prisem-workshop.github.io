<p>Enterprise and business modeling (EM/BM) are mature disciplines with long histories. Traditionally enterprise models
	were mostly aimed at information system design, but now they are often considered as a tool for coordinating
	business transformation. At the same time, more and less formal approaches to modeling (such as business model
	canvas, strategy maps) began to gain traction. Modeling became the basis for enterprise architecture and business
	architecture management (EAM/BAM). EM/BM and EAM/BAM has a potential to enhance and improve existing management
	practices, to add transparency and clarity to management decisions and to make organizations more aligned and
	adaptive.</p>

<p> In order to be useful and highly-demanded EM/BM and EAM/BAM must be seamlessly embedded into existing managerial
	practices and demonstrate added value. It requires a dialog between industry and academia, between IT and business
	people.
	There are some academic conferences (e.g. POEM, TEAR, EOMAS, VMBO etc.) and industrial events (e.g. events organized
	by Gartner, Business Architecture Guild, The Open Group etc.) in the area of EM/BM and EAM/BAM. Unfortunately there
	is a lack of interaction and communication between academia and industry in this area, the dialog is limited. This
	workshop is aimed to address this gap.</p>

<p>This workshop will team together people from academia and practitioners in order to share knowledge, ideas and
	lessons learned about the usage of EM/BM and EAM/BAM for business transformation (including digital transformation)
	and managerial decision making. The workshop will help academics better understand how EM/BM and EAM/BAM models,
	methods and tools are used in business practices and the challenges that practitioners are facing. On the other
	hand, the workshop will bring practitioners up to speed on the latest research and allow them to incorporate new
	ideas into their approaches.</p>



<p>Two types of papers are possible:</p>
<h4>Paper</h4>
<p>Maximum length 6 pages (including references).</p>
<h4>Slides-only</h4>
<p>Only an abstract</p>

<p>Plus, workshop attendees may also opt to showcase their tools/prototypes during the coffee break. </p>
